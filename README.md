MIMO (Multiple Input Multiple Output) is an antenna technology for wireless communications in which multiple antennas are used at both the transmitter and the receiver used to minimize errors, optimize data speed and improve the capacity of radio transmissions. The large number of antennas in MIMO systems and the presence of analog beamforming requires the development of specific channel estimation and precoding algorithms. An adaptive channel estimation algorithm can be used to estimate the channel parameters with low training overhead. To enable the efficient operation of this algorithm, a novel hierarchical multi-resolution codebook is designed to construct training beamforming vectors with different beamwidths. Using the estimated channel, the hybrid analog/digital precoding algorithm overcomes the hardware constraints on the analog-only beamforming, and approaches the performance of digital solutions. Simulation results show that the proposed low-complexity adaptive channel estimation algorithm displays a significant increase in  Spectral Efficiency compared to exhaustive channel training algorithms.
